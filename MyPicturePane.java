	/**
	 * In this method, you'll implement the dynamic programming algorithm
	 * that you learned on the first day of class to find the lowest cost seam from the top
	 * of the image to the bottom. BEFORE YOU START make sure you fully understand how the algorithm works
	 * and what it's doing.
	 * See the handout for some helpful resources and use hours/piazza to clarify conceptual blocks
	 * before you attempt to write code.
	 *
	 * This method returns an array of ints that represents a seam.  This size of this array
	 * is the height of the image.  Each entry of the seam array corresponds to one row of the
	 * image.  The data in each entry should be the x coordinate of the seam in this row.
	 * For example, given the below "image" where s is a seam pixel and - is a non-seam pixel
	 *
	 * - s - -
	 * s - - -
	 * - s - -
	 * - - s -
	 *
	 *
	 * the following code will properly return a seam:
	 *
	 * int[] currSeam = new int[4];
	 * currSeam[0] = 1;
	 * currSeam[1] = 0;
	 * currSeam[2] = 1;
	 * currSeam[3] = 2;
	 * return currSeam;
	 *
	 *
	 * This method is protected so it is accessible to the class MyPicturePane and is not
	 * accessible to other classes. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS!
	 *
	 * @return the lowest cost seam of the current image
