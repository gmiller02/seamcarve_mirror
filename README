seamcarve README

Handin: This is my final handin

My seamcarve has the following classes: App and MyPicturePane

App instantiates my MyPicturePane class.

Design choices: I think my design of MyPicturePane class is slightly unique. I created several helper methods to fill
my values table. I had three different methods that handle the rightmost, leftmost, and middle columns of pixels in the
image, and then I have a fillvalues method that uses those three methods to fill in my values array.

Known Bugs: I have no known bugs

Hours: This project took around 25 hours to complete
