seamcarve README

Handin: This is my final handin

Design choices: I think my design of MyPicturePane class is slightly unique. I created several helper methods to fill
my values table. I had three different methods that handle the rightmost, leftmost, and middle columns of pixels in the
image, and then I have a fillvalues method that uses those three methods to fill in my values array. All of my column-
filling methods return the sum of all of the differences of the values, and then I use those totals to caculate the
total importance of every possible neighbor.

Known Bugs: I have no known bugs.

Explanation of Test Cases: I know that my code is working as intended because it carves seams in a very similar method
to the demo: horizontal seams (up to 399) that compress the image. The only difference I can see is that mine runs
a little slower than the demo, but intellij runs slower on my mac because of the chip and processing system.
